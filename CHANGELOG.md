# BFVR Changelog

This file records user-visible changes to BFVR. GitHub Release notes should use
the v1.0.2 section exactly as written below.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Experimental standalone Meta Quest support through WinlatorXR (Wine and Box64
  on the headset). When BFVR detects WinlatorXR it takes head and controller
  tracking from WinlatorXR's XrAPI and draws both eyes side by side into the
  game window instead of starting `BFVRPresenter.exe`. Set
  `BFVR_WINLATORXR=0` or `1` to override detection and
  `BFVR_WINLATORXR_EYE_SIZE=WIDTHxHEIGHT` to change the per-eye size. The
  Quick Menu (hold right A), VR Settings, the "Back to game" button, comfort
  and death-camera vignettes, color profiles and the kill sound also work
  there. On the headset, the left trigger is "use", holding the left stick
  click opens the Quick Menu, A reloads, and a short B press selects
  the next weapon (holding B still recenters). The Windows PC
  version is unchanged.

## [1.0.2]

-Increased left hand grab radius from 12cm to 18cm.
-Increased scope aim smoothing radius from 0.35 degrees to 1.5 degrees.
-Doubled controller-motion turret/cannon sensitivity for land vehicles, sea vehicles, and mounted weapons compared to the original implementation and raised its input allowance to BF1942’s native maximum. There is now a sensitivity slider for it as well.
-Reduced the time it takes to trigger a view recenter when holding the reload button from 2.5 seconds to 2.
-Added a Show 'hands+arms, hands only, none' setting.
-Added a death cam comfort vignette effect with independent toggle.
-Added configurable 3D crosshair colors: White, Red, Blue, Green, Pink, Purple, Orange, and Yellow.
-Added a 3D crosshair toggle for knives/throwables/gadgets (off, on, hitmarker only).
-Added an opacity slider for 3D crosshairs.
-Added mouse cursor smoothing in menus to reduce shakiness.
-Added Color profiles (Original/Filmic/Vibrant).
-Added Exposure, Contrast, and Saturation sliders.
-Added optional Battlefield-style 'kill sound' with toggle (very satisfying!).
-Added Broadcast messages "Roger," "Negative," and "Go go go!" to the Quick Menu.
-VR Quick menu, settings menu, and main menu UI now use the same UI sounds BF and its mods do.
-Added the ability to toggle the native game HUD on/off.
-Added a toggle to keep the HUD upright or to follow your sideways head tilt.
-A fix was implemented to allow WMR Headset users using the Oasis driver to play (hopefully!).
-Fixed the left hand weapon grip/socket positions on the Russian DP, the MP18, Japanese Type5 rifle, Chinese AK47, and Saiga12k.
-Removed ability for controller motion to move your camera/head view in a non-gunner passenger position in vehicles. You can still turn your view with the right stick. It may still happen in some vehicles, especially in mods.
-Fixed ground shadow rendering for vehicles and soldiers so that they now render correctly.
-Slightly improved the way foliage between you and the water renders with SSR Water enabled.
-Potential improvement in performance when looking in the direction of large groups of soldiers.
-Redid the arm IK. Elbows should now be far less likely to flail wildly in random directions.
-Attempted to align the hands with the controllers better, but I admit it is inconsistent weapon to weapon. I have also added some sliders that allow you to align them to your liking as well.
-Fixed an offset in the wrists that would cause the ingame hands to swing out of alignment when you twisted your controllers.
-Fixed a bug that would leave your weapon/arms out of alignment when landing after a paradrop.
-Changed the relationship between head tilt and controller tilt when it comes to scoped weapon views. It should feel more natural now.
-Fixed an ambient occlusion rendering artifact that created a visible box-shaped brightness cutoff across floors, walls, and ceilings. AO now renders consistently across the full view.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Added compatibility for SteamVR OpenXR and Virtual Desktop through both its
  VDXR runtime and SteamVR mode.
- Added two saved aircraft control options: **Aircraft Pitch + Roll on Same
  Stick** and **Swap Aircraft Sticks**. Together they allow pitch/yaw or
  pitch/roll on either physical stick. Both default off, preserving the v1.0.0
  layout of left-stick throttle/roll and right-stick pitch/yaw.
- Added structural recognition of community packages that bundle BF42++ as a
  `dsound.dll` proxy, without restricting support to one exact proxy hash.

### Changed

- BFVR now supports either separately installed `bf42++.dll` or a recognized
  bundled BF42++ `dsound.dll`. When both are present, BFVR uses the bundled
  proxy and does not inject the second copy.
- BFVR disables Battlefield 1942's internal frame limiter only inside the
  BFVR-launched process, producing **far smoother gameplay** across the tested
  packages without editing `VideoDefault.con` or changing ordinary flat-game
  launches.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenXR instance startup on runtimes that require applications to
  request OpenXR 1.0, including the tested SteamVR and VDXR paths.
- Fixed SteamVR presentation synchronization so BFVR's shared-image GPU work
  overlaps the runtime's normal frame pacing instead of creating an additional
  serial wait.
- Isolated BFVR's D3D8-to-D3D9 presentation path from package-local dgVoodoo
  and DXVK/Vulkan renderer files while leaving those package files unchanged
  for ordinary Battlefield launches.

### Compatibility validated

- Meta Quest Link using the Meta OpenXR runtime.
- SteamVR OpenXR.
- Virtual Desktop using VDXR and using SteamVR mode.
- A Battlefield 1942 Anthology non-Vulkan/dgVoodoo installation.
- The Moongamers dgVoodoo package, which already bundles BF42++ as
  `dsound.dll`.
- A Battlefield 1942 Anthology VK/Vulkan installation with separately
  installed BF42++.
- Confirmed that BFVR will work on at least 4-6 different available versions of BF1942. The likelihood is that it will work for you.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-10

- Initial public BFVR release.
